Instructions for setup:​

1. To install "jsoncpp" as a dev dependency:  In my Linux OS, I have installed it by running the following command in the terminal:  ​

​               sudo apt install libjsoncpp-dev​

​
2. After its installation, we can run our code by going to the directory in which all the files are present and running:​

​               g++ Solution.cpp -ljsoncpp​

​

3. And to get the ouput in output.json file run: ./a.out​

   Results will automatically updated in output.json file.​
